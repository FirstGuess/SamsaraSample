# SamsaraSample
Code sample from my project for those interested

The primary script is PlayerStateMachine, which implements abstract class PlayerBaseState. It uses MoveData and MoveConfig, which are meant to be components alongside PlayerStateMachine on its intended GameObject.

I've also included two MP4 videos of gameplay, as well as a development build.
